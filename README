SYNOPSIS

    Ott is a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and
    calculi. It can generate LaTeX definitions for typesetting grammars
    and inference rules written in its domain-specific language for
    describing such things.

    This package redefines several macros that Ott generates for
    typesetting grammars and rules, and it provides several new macros
    that make it easy to include grammars and rules in a document on an
    individual basis.

BUILDING

    To build the PDF documentation and style file, merely run

        % make

    If you don't have make, it's possible to do it manually.  To create
    the style file (ottalt.sty) and the documentation (ottalt.pdf), run
    the following sequence of commands:

        latex ottalt.ins
        latex ottalt.dtx
        makeindex -s gind.ist ottalt.idx
        makeindex -s gglo.ist -o ottalt.gls ottalt.glo
        latex ottalt.dtx
        pdflatex ottalt.dtx

    If you only want to build the style file, and not the documentation,
    only the first command (latex ottalt.ins) is necessary.

    The documentation is also available on the web at
